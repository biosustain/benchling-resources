## About us 
Here at Biosustain, we have a dedicated, small **support team** for all Benchling-related matters, called the [LIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system) support team. We can support you in your daily usage of the platform, and help you with custom implementation, specific for your team or your project.
