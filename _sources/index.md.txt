# Welcome!

The Biosustain **Benchling Resources** page will help you navigate Benchling and successfully track and manage your experimental data during your time at Biosustain.

Here you will find **step-by-step tutorials** and short **training videos** covering topics like:
- How to access Benchling
- How to register data into the system
- How to submit requests for in-house services
- Highlights of new functionalities 

## Benchling in a nutshell

Benchling is an **online platform** that keeps your experimental data, electronic notebooks, and SOPs **all in one place**, making it easy to organize and link them together, and to share them with other researchers.

Here is an **overview of the main modules** in the system:
