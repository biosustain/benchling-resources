# Welcome!

The **Biosustain Benchling Resources Page** will help you navigate Benchling and successfully track and manage your experimental data during your time at Biosustain.

For a whole-round introduction to the platform, we suggest you to check-out the [_Introduction to Benchling_](/training_materials/basics.md) learing materials (or to directly attend one of our Benchling training session!).

Not all functionalities are covered by our guides.
