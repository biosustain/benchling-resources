# Welcome to the Biosustain Benchling Resources Page!

Here you will find **step-by-step guides** and **short videos** to help you navigate Benchling and successfully track and manage your experimental data during your time at Biosustain.

```{dropdown} Explore how we use Benchling at Biosustain
At Biosustain, we primarily use Benchling as the central platform for:
- samples metadata tracking
- sharing SOPs and electronic notebook (ELN) pages 
- in-silico molecular design

We also use the platform to submit requests for:
- in-house samples analysis to the [Analytics Team](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/technologies/biofoundry/analytics) and the [DNA Foundry](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/technologies/biofoundry/dna-foundry)
- orders for lab goods 
```

```{dropdown} Why centralized platforms matter
The main goal of using a centralized platform is to enhance **data findability** and **foster collaboration**. Your sample metadata, notes and SOPs are stored in a single location and linked to each other using notebook @tags and metadata @entity links.
```
