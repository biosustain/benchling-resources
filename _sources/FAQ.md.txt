Make sure they are included in the collaborators of your Benchling project.
- If they are part of your team, [add them in the Benchling Team](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684243670029-Add-or-remove-members-of-a-team-Enterprise) of your research group and [add the Team as collaborator in your project](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684263074445-Set-project-permissions).
- If they are not part of your team, [add them directly as collaborator](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684263074445-Set-project-permissions) in your project.
