# Try out Plate Maps

Benchling plate mapping is a useful tool for **planning, visualising and registering** your plate experiments:

- You can add multiple layers of annotations and values to create a digital record of your plate experiment.

- You can insert the resulting map in your ELN and navigate through the different variables in the wells.

- You can access or search the plate data stored the inventory.

## Before starting

Before creating the Plate Map, make sure the contents you want to fill the plate with are [registered](https://biosustain.github.io/benchling-resources/guides/use_registry.html) and containable (see note for list of containable entities). You can also add those entities to a worklist to facilitate filling up the plate in bulk.

**Summary of the steps:**

1. **Create a plate map**

    To create a plate map, you can insert it into a Notebook entry (as showed in the video), or create it within the Benchling inventory:

            Notebook entry > "Insert" > "Plate Map"

    or

            Benchling Navigation Bar > "Create (+)" > "Plate" 

2. **Choose the fixed plate type**

    Choose between 6-well, 12-well, 24-well, 48-well, 96-well, or 384-well plates. Designate a location in the inventory, or fill other fields for that plate schema.

3. **Annotate the wells in the plate**

    Select multiple wells at once by dragging the cursor or by using the *shift* key, or fill wells individually.
    - **Add the well contents** from the registry or from your worklist.
    - **Assign roles to the wells**: samples, controls, blanks or standards.
    - **Add additional labels with the Well schema fields**: Treatment and Dilution Factor.

4. **Specify the concentrations and volumes of  your contents**
   
    Indicate the values for the contents filling up the plate in your experiment: total well volume, stock concentration, transfer volume and well concentration.
