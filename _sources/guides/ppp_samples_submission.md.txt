# Submit samples for analysis to Pre-Pilot-Plant (PPP)

Benchling has replaced one of its modules (**“Requests”**) with another new module (**“Workflow”**). To discover how to submit samples for analysis to the Pre-Pilot-Plant (PPP) team using Workflows, follow this guide. 

## Grant access to the PPP team to your Project
Add _Pre-Pilot Plant (PPP) Translational_ Benchling Team to the list of collaborators in your Project to enable the analysts to access the samples you are going to register. 

1. Navigate to your Benchling **Project settings** ⚙️

2. Add the _Pre-Pilot Plant (PPP) Translational_ Benchling Team to the list of collaborators (with **"WRITE"** access)

## Register samples directly in your Notebook Entry

In order to register samples to submit to PPP, you can follow a **Sub-template** created by LIMS support for this purpose. 

Follow this video to learn how to do it:

````

_Summary of the steps:_

1. Navigate to your experiment **Notebook Entry**

2. Insert the **sub-template** "PPP Sample Submission" in the Entry

    → You can choose between different samples storage options: **Plate**, **Box**, single **Vials**.

3. **Fill-in** the registration and inventory tables that appeared in your Notebook Entry with the required metadata.

    ```{admonition} *Note*
    :class: my-custom-admonition

    When moving samples in a Box or a Plate, please do so **row-wise** (A1, A2, A3...) as showed in the video.

    ```
4. **Copy** (Command+C / CTRL+C) the newly-registered **samples entities** from the last table

## Create a Workflow

In order to submit your newly-registered samples for analysis to the PPP team, you need to create a Workflow and attach the samples within it. 

 ```{admonition} *Note*
:class: my-custom-admonition

In order to submit your newly-registered samples for analysis to the PPP team, you need to create a Workflow and attach the samples within it. The Workflow to submit samples to the PPP team is labelled with "PPP".

```

## VERY IMPORTANT!!

When creating a workflow, **paste all the samples in one single cell** in the "PPP Samples" column (as showed in the screenshot downbelow, and in the video). If you have sample-level metadata, please add them in the previous step (when you are registering the  samples in your Notebook entry). 

```{figure} ../_static/images/important-samples-in-one-cell-ppp.png

```

You can achieve it by using the "Paste special" button:

```

_Summary of the steps:_

1. **Create** a Workflow of the relevant type, based on the analysis your are interested in.

2. **Select "Table" format** for your Task table

```{figure} ../_static/images/table-format-in-workflow-ppp.png

```

3. **Paste** the samples entities in a **single** **PPP Samples** column cell 

```{figure} ../_static/images/paste-special-ppp.png
:alt: Use Paste Special to paste all samples in one cell
:width: 80%
:align: center

```

4. **Fill-in** the remaining metadata fields.

→ Remember to specify the correct **"Project number"** and to save the Workflow in the relevant **Project folder** (the video's Project number and Project folder are used as examples).

5. Click on **"Create"**. The analyst will receive an email and therefore will be informed about your submission. 

## List of available Workflows

This is the available list of Workflows (currently only one for the PPP Team):
