If you need to submit samples for analysis to the Analytics team, follow [this guide](/guides/ac_samples_submission.md) instead.
``` 

If you need to submit a request for in-house samples analysis, the main steps are:

## 1. Register samples (create Notebook entry)

- Register samples to be analyzed in Benchling. You can follow a template that we created for this purpose: 

        Benchling Navigation Bar >  “Create (+)” > “Entry” > “Entry from template”

```{figure} ../_static/images/entry-from-template.png
:alt: create a entry from template

:align: center

```

- Select the appropriate template from the list and go through it:

    - *“DNF Nanopore Sample Submission”* 
    - *“IPC Analytics Sample Submission”*

## 2. Submit samples (create Request)

- Create a new request (select the appropriate request from the list down-below)

        Benchling Navigation Bar >  “Request” > “Create (+)” > Select request type of interest

- Attach submission samples (created in step 1) to the newly created request:

```{figure} ../_static/images/attach-samples-to-request.png

```
