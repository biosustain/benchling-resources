# Access to Benchling and its data

ðŸŽ¯ This guide provides an overview of how **permissions** are managed in Benchling, as well as [whom to contact](#contact-information) for different permission-related issues. 

## Access to Benchling
**First-time access** is granted by HR. Contact [Biosustain HR](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/medarbejder/hr-og-arbejdsmiljoe/kontakt-hr) to request access (for you or a colleague). 

If your account (or a colleague's account) has been **suspended**, contact [LIMS Support](/contact.md) and ask for its reactivation. 
Reasons for the suspension include inactivity for multiple months or being a past employee that has returned to Biosustain after a period of time.

## Access to a Benchling Team

A **Team** is a collection of users who can be granted access to projects collectively, simplifying permission management. You can add a Team as collaborator in your Project to share your data to all the members of the Team.

Once a new user has logged-in into Benchling for the first time (**not before that**), the user can be added to a Benchling Team by a Team Admin. 

- [How to add a user to your Benchling Team](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684243670029-Add-or-remove-members-of-a-team-Enterprise) (note that only Team Admins can add new users to a Team)

_Note: If you cannot see the icon "**Add Member**" in your Team, it means that you are not a Team Admin. Ask the Team Admin to change your role, if needed._

## Access to a Benchling Project

A **Project** is a workspace for storing and organizing research data. In Benchling,permissions to access data are assigned at the project level. A Project Admin can add people to a Project (either a single user or a full Team, with Viewer, Editor or Admin role). 

- [How to add a user or a Team as collaborator in your project](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684263074445-Set-project-permissions)

_Note: If you cannot add/edit collaborators in your Project, it means that you are not a Project Admin. Ask the Project Admin to change your role, if needed._

## Access for external collaborators
