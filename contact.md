If you have **questions about Benchling** or any advice on how to improve current data workflows, you can contact us at [lims_support@biosustain.dtu.dk](mailto:lims_support@biosustain.dtu.dk).
We are always open to feedback and suggestions!

If you need **hands-on support**, you can join Benchling *Drop-in hours*, happening every Monday (13:00-14:00) at Biosustain. Every week you will receive a reminder in the Microsoft Teams *General* channel with information about the meeting room location (always at Biosustain).

*LIMS support is part of the [Informatic Platforms](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/technologies/informatics) at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability*
