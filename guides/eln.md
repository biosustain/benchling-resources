# Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

 ðŸŽ¯ Learning goals
- Tools and functionalities inside an entry
- Templates and subtemplates
- Tips to structure/organize your ELN

## Introduction

Documenting experiments is an indispensable part of scientific research.

Much like the traditional paper notebook, you can open a blank entry of the electronic lab notebook (ELN) and start writing your experimental notes. However, the ELN is built to facilitate and elevate note taking, as it offers:

- Tools for structuring your notes, plus additional tools supporting expriment planning and reporting
- Ability to connect notes to data in the LIMS
- Ability to create entries from templates
- History and version control with ease
- Searchable notes

In this guide you will learn how to make the most out of the ELN capabilities to make experiment documentation easier and more powerful.

## 5 tips for making the most of the ELN

### Tip 1: Version control your ELN
(Good to know from the beginning - potential life saver)
With each new edit to your ELN, Benchling automatically saves a version of the entry. This allows you to go through the history of versions of your entry and if you ever come to need it, you can:
- **Restore the entry to a previous version**, e.g. because you accidentally deleted/added unwanted content.
- **Clone a version of the entry to a new entry**, e.g. because you want to try and compare different methodologies during part of an experiment.

### Tip 2: Use tools within the ELN for planning and reporting experiments - tables, file viewing, figure annotation
(You don't need to leave the ELN)
More than a simple word processer, the ELN provides extra tools that support the planning and reporting of experiments.

Shortcut to insert elements into your ELN:
when you type **`/`**, a dropdown emerges, select the element in the dropdown.
```

#### Use tables to perform spreadsheet calculations
Tables in the ELN allow you to perform calculations and format table similarly to other spreadsheet applications. 
- Writing your **formulas** using '=' to begin, and anchoring cells in a formula with '$'.
- Using predefined **functions** (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, etc.).
- Converting to **scientific notation** and setting **decimal precision**.
- Dragging cell to **auto-fill numerical series**.
- Merging cells, and deleting/inserting rows or columns.
- Formatting cell and text colours.

#### Insert and view files within your ELN
You can upload files up to 2GB directly into an entry. This is easily accomplished by either **drag-and-drop** or **copy-paste** of a file, or by clicking **Insert > Attachment > select file**. If larger files are needed, store them externally and link the file.

Images are displayed directly in the entry, while attachements such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF and text files can be viewed in a tab that opens within the entry upon clicking on the file.

#### Annotate images
Benchling now allows you to annotate images within entries. When you click "Annotate image" you are given the option of adding **text**, **arrows** or **circles**, then dragging, re-sizing and coloring these elements.

#### ? Structured tables

### Tip 3: Link the experimental entities in your ELN
You can create internal links to Benchling entities, entries or users: By typing "@", a prompt allows you to search and select the object within Benchling that you want to link, and you can do so within your text or tables. 
With internal links you can connect the entities in an experiment (strains, plasmids, primers, etc.) and the documentation of that experiment, enabling a more precise and systematical report. The relationships established between items across your project is shown in their Metadata section under "Relevant Items".

### Tip 4: Organize and navigate your notes with ease
- Structure with sections
- Structure text with headers, lists
- All the formatting that improve your notes readability
- Table of contents

### Tip 5: Templates and subtemplates are great
Templates and subtemplates provide standardized layouts as starting points for your ELN entries:
- Create an entry following a **template** layout.
- Use a **subtemplate** to insert reusable content within an entry.

With templates and subtemplates you can cut down on manually writing and structuring your notes, which can both be laborious and lead to inconsistent documentation across collaborative projects. 
- Streamline documentation process
- Ensure consistency and completedness of your notes
- Ensure compliance with well-defined workflows

#### Use your team's collection of templates

Templates and subtemplates are organized into collections. Each team builds their collection of templates. Permissions are set at the collection level. **If your team does not have a collection of templates, create one:**

    - You can always edit the name and permissions of your collection
    - Table of permissions

#### Create a template 
- Templates as better protocols

#### Use a template
- Example: USER cloning

#### Subtemplates
