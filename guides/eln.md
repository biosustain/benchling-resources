# Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

 ðŸŽ¯ Learning goals
- Tools and functionalities inside an entry
- Templates and subtemplates
- Tips to structure/organize your ELN

## Introduction

Documenting experiments is an indispensable part of scientific research.

Much like the traditional paper notebook, you can open a blank entry of the electronic lab notebook (ELN) and start writing your experimental notes. However, the ELN is built to facilitate and elevate note taking, as it offers:

- Tools for structuring your notes
- Ability to connect notes to data in the LIMS, or to add external links
- Ability to create entries from templates
- History and version control
- Searchable notes

In this guide you will learn how to make the most out of the ELN capabilities to make experiment documentation easier and more powerful.

## Inside an ELN entry

Entries provide multiple formatting options and acessory functionalities that facilitate writing clear and well-structured experimental notes. Bellow you can learn about these functionalities in more detail, and you can try them out yourself with [this entry template].

````{dropdown} Text formatting

Similarly to other word processors, in the Benchling ELN you can: toggle headers, format text style and change text or highlight color.

````
````{dropdown} Structure notes with Sections or Day separators
Add a calendar day for your entry: adding new days causes the entry to span multiple days in your personal calendar

````
````{dropdown} Link to items within Benchling or to external URLs

**You can create internal links to Benchling entities, entries or users:** By typing "@", a prompt appears that allows you to search and select the object within Benchling that you want to link.
With internal links you can connect the entities in an experiment (strains, plasmids, primers, etc.) and the documentation of that experiment, enabling you to report your research more precisely and systematically. The relationships established between items across your project is shown in their Metadata section under "Relevant Items".

**You can also link to external URLs:** Integrate links to external URLs in the text of the ELN entry.

````{dropdown} Attach external images and files

attach images, pdf, pwp or csv files.

For enterprise and non-academic users, attachments are limited to 2GB per file. If larger files are needed, store them externally and link the file to redirect users.

````

````{dropdown} Insert tables

enter free-form data, format table and perform calculations as you would in other spreadsheet applications. support formulas, functions, scientific notation, and precision settings

````

````{dropdown} Insert structured tables

see introduction guide

````


````{dropdown} Table of contents
Automatic, click through to navigate the elements in your notes
The Notebook automatically creates a dynamic table of contents that is organized by section, then headers, inserted tables (structured and unstructured), attachments, and text boxes. By toggling over the table of contents feature to the right of your screen, you can easily navigate lengthy or multi-day experiments within sections. Sections, headers, and days create these references in the table of contents automatically.


````

````{dropdown} History and version control 
View, Reset, or Clone Previous Versions of an Entry
benchling is saving as you go, you can access history of versions of your entry (by timestamp) 
View, Reset, or Clone Previous Versions of an Entry

The clock icon in the top right corner of the Notebook allows you to review the version history of an entry, and reset to an earlier one if needed. A new version saves automatically while you are editing.
If you accidentally deleted necessary content in an Entry or added unwanted content, you can select the timestamp from before you made the edits to reset your entry to that version. 

For example, if you accidentally deleted a table between 11:45 AM and 12:06 PM, then you could select the 2/28/2022 11:45 AM timestamp, then select reset to version to make the table appear in your entry once again. 
Cloning from version allows you to copy a version of an entry into a new entry.

For example, if you decided during part of an experiment that you wanted to try two different methods to compare the results, then you could clone the entry and compare the different methodologies.

## Templates and subtemplates

Write in an unstructured manner, or give a structure to your notes manually, **or use templates**

 (agility, reproducibility)

## Tips

Use `/` shortcut to insert elements to entry.
