## Introduction

Documenting experiments is an indispensable part of scientific research.

Much like the traditional paper notebook, you can open a blank entry of electronic lab notebook (ELN) and start writing your experimental notes. However, the ELN is built to facilitate and elevate note taking as it offers:

- Tools for structuring your notes
- Connecting notes to data in the LIMS or external links
- Ability to create entries from templates (agility, reproducibility)
- History and version control
- Easy search within your notes

In this guide you will learn how to make the most out of the ELN capabilities to make experiment documentation easier and more powerful.

## Inside an ELN entry

Inside an entry you have multiple formatting tools to help build your ELN.
- Format and structure text: toggle headers, add colors, links, lists and checkboxes, separaters
- Insert elements: tables, images, files, code blocks
- Table of contents and Version control
