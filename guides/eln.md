# Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

 🎯 Learning goals
- Tools and functionalities inside an entry
- Templates and subtemplates
- Tips to structure/organize your ELN

## Introduction

Documenting experiments is an indispensable part of scientific research.

Much like the traditional paper notebook, you can open a blank entry of the electronic lab notebook (ELN) and start writing your experimental notes. However, the ELN is built to facilitate and elevate note taking, as it offers:

In this guide you will **learn how to make the most out of the ELN capabilities to make experiment documentation easier and more powerful**:

✅ Version control your ELN

✅ Link the experimental entities in your ELN

✅ Leverage templates and subtemplates for better note taking

✅ Organize and navigate your notes with ease

✅ Use tools helpful for planning and reporting experiments within the ELN - tables, file viewing, figure annotation

---

## ✅ Learn to version control your ELN
As you edit your ELN entry, Benchling is automatically saving each version of your entry. This enables you to access the history of versions of your entry and if you ever come to need it, you can:
- **Restore the entry to a previous version**, e.g. because you accidentally deleted/added content.
- **Clone a version to a new entry**, e.g. because you want to try and compare different methodologies during part of an experiment.

## ✅ Link the experimental entities in your ELN
You can create internal links to Benchling entities, entries or users: By typing "@", a prompt allows you to search and select the object within Benchling that you want to link, and you can do so within your text or tables. 
With internal links you can connect the entities in an experiment (strains, plasmids, primers, etc.) and the documentation of that experiment, enabling a more precise and systematical report. The relationships established between items across your project is shown in their Metadata section under "Relevant Items".

## ✅ Leverage templates and subtemplates for better note taking
Research in the lab often involves recurring workflows and, naturally, repetitive note taking. It is for such cases that templates and subtemplates are particularly useful.

Templates and subtemplates are standardized layouts that can be used as starting points for your ELN entries. These enable you to cut down on manually writing and structuring notes, which can both be laborious and lead to inconsistent documentation across collaborative projects.

```

- **Templates** are useful for documenting stable and repeatable processes. The template defines the general content of your entry, then you can add the details specific to the experiment. ***Example: template for well-defined cloning method***.

    Alternatively, templates can be simply used for establishing a structure to different types of documents. ***Example: templates to set a specific structure for protocols and reports.***.

- **Subtemplates** are flexible snippets of content that can be inserted anywhere in an entry, therefore are useful for processes that reocur across experiments. ***Example: subtemplate with tables and checklists to set up PCR reaction***.

```

Summary of steps:
1. `Create > Entry > Entry from template`
2. Search for and select template
3. Name entry and indicate entry's initial date
4. Create entry
5. Edit and write in entry to document your experiment

Summary of steps:
1. Open entry
2. `Insert > Subtemplate`
3. Search for and select subtemplate

### Develop a team template collection
Templates and subtemplates are organized into collections. Each team should develop their own collection of templates. This is helpful not only for sharing templates that are useful across the team, but also for establishing a common-ground - structuring the documentation process as a team to facilitate collaboration.
**If your team does not have a template collection, create one**.

*Note:*

**Permissions for templates are set at the collection level.** See below the different tiers of permissions that can be granted to users or teams for template collections:

| Permissions | None | Read | Write | Admin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View Templates in Template Collection | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Create Notebook Entries from Templates | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Create New Templates in Template Collections | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

Templates and subtemplates are created within template collections.

</iframe>
</div>
```

Summary of steps:
1. Navigate to the template collection
2. `Create > Entry template`
3. Write and design template like you would for a normal notebook entry

*Note:* To create a subtemplate instead of a template, follow the video tutorial but in the 'Create' dropdown select **Subtemplate** option (`Create > Subtemplate`).

## ✅ Organize and navigate your notes with ease
- Structure with sections
- Structure text with headers, lists
- All the formatting that improve your notes readability
- Table of contents


## ✅ Use tools within the ELN for planning and reporting experiments - tables, file viewing, figure annotation
(You don't need to leave the ELN)
More than a simple word processer, the ELN provides extra tools that support the planning and reporting of experiments. 

```{tip}
Shortcut to insert elements into your ELN:
when you type **`/`**, a dropdown emerges, select the element in the dropdown.
```

### Use tables to perform spreadsheet calculations
Tables in the ELN allow you to perform calculations and format table similarly to other spreadsheet applications. 
- Writing your **formulas** using '=' to begin, and anchoring cells in a formula with '$'.
- Using predefined **functions** (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, etc.).
- Converting to **scientific notation** and setting **decimal precision**.
- Dragging cell to **auto-fill numerical series**.
- Merging cells, and deleting/inserting rows or columns.
- Formatting cell and text colours.

### Insert and view files within your ELN
You can upload files up to 2GB directly into an entry. This is easily accomplished by either **drag-and-drop** or **copy-paste** of a file, or by clicking **Insert > Attachment > select file**. If larger files are needed, store them externally and link the file.

Images are displayed directly in the entry, while attachements such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF and text files can be viewed in a tab that opens within the entry upon clicking on the file.

### Annotate images
Benchling now allows you to annotate images within entries. When you click "Annotate image" you are given the option of adding **text**, **arrows** or **circles**, then dragging, re-sizing and coloring these elements.
