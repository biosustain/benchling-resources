## Introduction

Documenting experiments is an indispensable part of scientific research.

Much like the traditional paper notebook, you can open a blank entry of the electronic lab notebook (ELN) and start writing your experimental notes. However, the ELN is built to facilitate and elevate note taking, as it offers:

- Tools for structuring your notes
- Ability to connect notes to data in the LIMS
- Ability to create entries from templates
- History and version control with ease
- Searchable notes
