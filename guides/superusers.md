# ðŸ‘¤ Benchling superusers at Biosustain

Benchling superusers are researchers who are the main contact point between their research group and the [LIMS support team](/contact.md). Superusers also support their colleagues by addressing their doubts, by sharing training materials ang guides, and by encouraging them to [contact the LIMS team](/contact.md) when needed.

## Are you a superuser? 
Here are some important pieces of information for you.

As a superusers, understanding a few basic concepts of Benchling will help you to better support your team and to have a smoother experience when encountering issues in Benchling.

### âœ… Benchling access

- Benchling access in managed by Biosustain HR.
- Benchling user accounts are automatically suspended at the end of the users's contract, and reactivated if the user gets a new contract.
- If a user needs prolonged access to Benchling (after the contract end date), the user needs to contact Biosustain HR and ask for an extension. 

ðŸ“‹ If a colleague needs access to Benchling, follow these steps:
1. First, share with them the link to Benchling and check if they can already login.
2.  - If they cannot login, ask your colleague  to contact Biosustain HR and ask for access. 
    - If the account is found to be suspended, or if an existing account is denying them access, ask your colleague to contact LIMS support.

### âœ… Benchling teams

- In Benchling, data access is managed through user teams ("Benchling Teams").
- If you are part of a Team, you can see all the data ("Benchling Projects") that were shared with that Team.
- Every research group has its own Benchling Team.
- You can see in which Teams you are part of by going to the user settings:

ðŸ“‹ If a colleague needs access to a team Project, follow these steps:
1. First, check if your Team is part of the Project collaborator list in the Project setting. 

```{figure} ../_static/images/superusers-check-collaborators.png

:align: center
```

2.  - If the Team is not in the list, and you would like to add it, add the Team as collaborator in the Project
    - If the Team is in the list, then you simply need to make sure that your colleague is added to the Benchling Team (by you, or by the Team admin/s)

```

_Note: If the Project data needs to stay more private (no access to the whole Team), it is possible to add single users as collaborators._

If your colleague needs help in other aspects, and you don't know the answer, please share with them the link to this Benchling resources page (https://biosustain.github.io/benchling-resources/) or ask them to contact the [LIMS Support team]((/contact.md)).
