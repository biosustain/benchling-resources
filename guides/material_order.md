# Submit a lab material order

Equipment and consumable procurement is managed by Biosustain procurement team. 

To submit your order request to the procurement team, follow the down-below guide.

_Note: If you have already received a quote, you don't need to follow the guide. In your case, you can forward the quote from the supplier (along with your project number and task number) to **cfb-procure@biosustain.dtu.dk**._
