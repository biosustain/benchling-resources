# Register fermentation data (for PPP and IFP)

🎯 This guide will show you how to use the template ***"Registering Fermentation Data in Benchling"*** to keep track of fermentation experiments and the samples they generate. 

## 📝 Create a new Fermentation Data Entry from a Template 

The first step is to create a new Entry using the required Template. 

Follow this video to learn how to do it:

````{raw} html
<div style="text-align: center;">

    height="347"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYKo29SY8RI?si=6XbqoswJwuZfsPMP?rel=0&modestbranding=1&autoplay=0&showinfo=0" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>
````

*Summary of the steps:*

1. Navigate to the Benchling folder where you want to register fermentation data. 
2. Create an **Entry from Template** and select the template *Registering Fermentation Data in Benchling* in the folder *Fermentation Reports (LIMS)*. 

Once you have created the Entry, you can start filling in the relevant tables.

## 🔍 Steps 1 to 3 - Planning and registering related Entities 

The first steps involve creating or locating Entities that are relevant to the Fermentation process.

* **Step 1 - Register Experiment**
* **Step 2 - Register Media**
* **Step 3 - Register Strains**

1. The tables included in these steps may be omitted if you have already registered the entities beforehand. 
2. Entities created through these tables will be found in the same folder where the Entry is located. You can *move* them manually into the correct folder through the *expanded view*.

## 🧪 Steps 4 and 5 - Fermentation Cultures and Samples 

These steps cover logging details for each stage of the fermentation train (e.g., reactor settings, final OD, culture volume) and recording metadata for samples retrieved from the main fermentation (e.g., OD, time, cells/mg, sample type).

* **Step 4 - Register Fermentation Cultures and Results (Pre-optional, pre-final, main cultures)**
* **Step 5 - Register Timepoint Samples**

Follow this video for an example of how to fill the tables in steps 4 and 5:

## 🔬 Steps 6 to 8 - Preparing Samples for Analysis

The last steps cover creating samples for analysis, assigning them a storage location, and submitting the Workflow to Analytics or the Pre-Pilot Plant.

* **Step 6 - Register Analytical Submission Samples**
* **Step 7 - Move Analytical Submission Samples in a storage location**
* **Step 8 - Submit Workflow to Analytics**

The videos below show how to achieve this. 

### ☑️ Create and store Analytical Submission Samples
